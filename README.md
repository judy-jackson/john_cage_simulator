John Cage Music simulation:


The user should place the audio files folder (labeled "cage_clips"--DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER)
and the image files folder (labeled "iching_cards"--do not change this name either)
into the SAME folder on their computer.

This folder (in which the audio and image folders have been placed in)
is the folder filepath that the user will need to enter when prompted by the program.

Do not forget the '/' at the end of the filepath name.

Do not enter the complete filepath to the audio/image folder (i.e "/Users/jcj1108/Desktop/csci/cage_clips/")
Instead enter the filepath to the folder that they are contained in (i.e "/User/jcj1108/Desktop/csci/")

If prompted with a filename error, please double check this. Do not enter an abbreviated filepath.
Enter the entire filepath (i.e second example above instead of ".../csci/")

Entering the filepath is the only action the user needs to take.
The program will run by itself after that point.

The program will tell you the length of the piece (i.e "8 minutes") in the terminal window.
It will play audio clips for that length of time.
It will also display the I-Ching cards corresponding to the excerpts in a new window.

To quit the program (after audio has finished), close the image window.
To quit the program (before audio has finished), close the image window and Ctrl + C.

There is a slight delay before audio runs after the program is started. Be patient.

Have fun!
